;;; Task 1A.
;; There are several ways of defining context of words in  addition to the bag-of-words approuch
;; this assignment will use. One alternative to the bag-of-words definition is to use context
;; windows. With the context windows method we define context as the N number of words before
;; and after the current word we are focusing on. If we have the sentence
;; "Here are five given words" and we have "five" as our focus words and N = 1,
;; then the features for "five" is ["are", "given"].

;; We could also have defined context as grammatical context which looks at the grammatical
;; relations to other words.
